Thats what I will try to acheive for the landing page, and try to similarly theme every other page.

ideas:
 - As you scroll down, it will first reach the end of the short scroll bar on the left, then zoom into the center blob thing. That will bring you to the projects page
 - Blog????
 - ^, I really dont have much to talk about, but it would probably be something to do with my school. Ill figure it out.
 - Maybe have a first login type thing? Ion know, beats me.
